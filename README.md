🧠 CS @ Boston University  
⚙️ Backend Engineer & Systems Thinker  
📡 TPM @ BU Spark | SWE Intern @ Fidelity Investments  
📱 Founding Backend Engineer @ Mob (social discovery startup)

I build infrastructure that scales and systems people don’t have to think about. From LLM-powered social platforms to civic tech and distributed consensus — I work where reliability meets clarity.
