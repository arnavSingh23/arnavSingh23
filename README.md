🧠 CS @ Boston University  
⚙️ Backend Engineer & Systems Thinker  
📡 TPM @ BU Spark | SWE Intern @ Fidelity Investments  
📱 Founding Backend Engineer @ Mob (social discovery startup)

I design and manage systems that power real-world impact — from civic tech platforms and living labs to research bots and social justice tools. I’ve led engineering across BU Spark! projects like Civera's MassCourts and the BU Community Service Center, while also building infrastructure from the ground up: matrix operation packages for genomic data, the backend for a social discovery app, and distributed consensus protocols. My focus is on systems that scale reliably and communicate clearly — whether it’s LLM-native applications or crash-tolerant algorithms.
